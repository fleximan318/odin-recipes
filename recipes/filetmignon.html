        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 filet mignon steaks (1 1/2 inch thick)
                <li>¾ cup crumbled blue cheese   
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
                <li> ¼ cup panko bread crumbs  
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is tender. Stir in the beef broth, scraping any onion bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the port wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup. Set aside. This may also be made ahead of time, and reheated.
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a cast-iron or other oven-safe skillet over high heat. Sear steaks quickly on both sides until brown, then place the whole pan into the oven.
